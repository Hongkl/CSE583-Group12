# Functional Specification
## Background
So far, more than 50 million people have been infected COVID-19 worldwide, but we know: with the joint efforts of people, we will eventually overcome this pandemic. As graduate students in UW, we really care about how COVID-19 affects our community especially in the King county area. If in the future we want to look back on those past days and learn how it impacted our daily life, we need a tool to help us better visualize those data. 

For this reason, our project aims to provide a web-based visualization tool. We are going to combine COVID-19 dataset with other kinds of datasets (Employment & Unemployment Rate data, Consumer Price Index data, etc.) to show its impact on King county intuitively.

Our project includes an interactive map from which users can check the history data for different places of King County and make a comparison between different areas.
