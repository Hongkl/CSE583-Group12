### Background:
So far, more than 50 million people have been infected COVID-19 worldwide, but we know: with the joint efforts of people, we will eventually overcome this pandemic. As graduate students in UW, we really care about how COVID-19 affects our community especially in the Washington State area. If in the future we want to look back on those past days and learn how it impacted our daily life, we need a tool to help us better visualize those data.  

For this reason, our project aims to provide a web-based visualization tool. We are going to combine COVID-19 dataset with Unemployment Rate data to show its impact on every counties in Washington State intuitively.  

Our project includes an interactive map from which users can check the history data for different counties in Washington State and make a comparison between different areas.
